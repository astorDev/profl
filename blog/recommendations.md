I worked together with Egor back in my days at PickPoint. When I first met him he was the youngest software engineer in the team and I was impressed by his level of technical skills and knowledge. Later on, I found out that he's a good team player, too. He was the one who always strived for company progress both in technological and organizational aspects. He took responsibility for a few projects and successfully delivered them, further improving in his team management skills. Moreover, he was always ready to help his colleagues and share his knowledge with them. I've witnessed his rapid professional growth which resulted in his well-deserved promotion from a software engineer to a software architect. I can easily recommend Egor as a highly skilled software engineer, a great leader, and a good team player.
