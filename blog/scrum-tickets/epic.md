# Epic

> Start epic

If you've heard anything about Scrum, or Agile you probably also heard about epics. A big set of work that has one common objective. The most high-level ticket in Scrum. Sounds straightforward, right? But if a product owner is supposed to bring a pack of user stories to the sprint planning, should epics even exist? Who should write it? Here are my thoughts.

Epics aren't a required ticket. But frequently stakeholders want to see a high-level overview of a project's steps, ideally with deadlines on a calendar. That often leads to creating a grant diagram. But that's anti-scrum. Anti-agile. Instead, epics could be used to provide the experience. And map the sprint's progress to a long-term progress overview. In my understanding, this is okay to put them on a calendar. Because unlike putting user stories on a grant diagram that still allows adapting to changes.

Additionally, epics could provide a starting point for a product owner, narrowing down the scope in which user stories are created. That will work if the epic is written by a person who has a vision of the product. Ideally, the CEO, CTO, or Chief Product Officer. The project manager or business analyst reviews whether Epic provides them extensive guidance on what the end result should look like. Checking that they understand against which values the end result will be evaluated.

If done perfectly, epics could be the common language of the very top management and the development team. Providing the first group with a clear picture of the product vision and progress and providing the second group with a clear context in which they are creating the product. Honestly, reaching that quality of epics is extremely rare and challenging. However, I believe understanding the purpose of epics and the perfect scenario of their creation and review is a good start.
