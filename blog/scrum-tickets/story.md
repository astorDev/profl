# User stories

> It all starts with a story ... a user story

User stories are perhaps the most important ticket type in Scrum. They are presented to the development team, they are estimated, and they are completed. But the process around them is still vague. In a scrum book, you've probably seen that user stories are brought by the product owner on the sprint planning and discussed to form a sprint backlog. However, in real life that's very rare to see a person with a product owner title. And a story clarification may not fit into the dedicated timespan in the sprint planning. I'll try to address those issues and draw a real-world scenario of working with user stories from a thought to an implemented change.

I'd start by highlighting the "user" part. A story should focus on what the user will see, not how it should be implemented, so the person creating the story should be a business-minded person. Business analyst sounds like the most suited role for that. But a project manager is also a good candidate. If the feature is expected to have some UI impact a UI / UX designer should be a co-author of the ticket.

But what in my mind is equally important is a review process. And I don't feel like embedding the whole development team in the process is a rational approach. It will allocate resources a lot more efficiently if at least a first-sight review is performed by a dedicated professional. It's important to review the story from two angles: does it match a global business strategy and is it sufficiently described and technically feasible? The first angle, in ideal, is reviewed by a CTO / CEO / CPO. The second is reviewed by Team Lead, Software Architect, and QA lead.

An ideal user story will describe what a user will have after its implementation. It will both show a stakeholder how their vision is transformed into an actual app behavior and guide a developer to what the end result will look like. User stories are so fundamental that if they are done right everything else will almost automatically fall into place. However, if done badly the whole process will be like building a home on a rotten foundation. So try to set up a user story review process with people from different roles involved. It'll make sure your journey starts with a good story.
