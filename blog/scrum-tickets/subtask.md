# Subtask

> The agile ticket type you've probably missed ðŸ˜²

When you have a task on your hand you're almost ready to go. However, there may be few people involved even if a single technical unit like an endpoint or UI component. One person can be responsible for the deployment, one for coding, and one for testing. Here subtasks come in handy. If you feel like splitting a task is an overhead this is totally fine. Subtasks are completely optional. They are mostly needed if you need to assign parts of a task to different people.

This is also a team-level business. No one outside of a team has a say in this. A team lead or any other senior-level person can create a ticket of that type. A subtask describes a precise set of actions for a single person. So the assignee is the only person who should review the ticket.

If a few people needed to complete a single task subtasks come into play. They come in handy sometimes but a scrum team should focus on writing a good user story and tasks first.
