# Subtask

> The agile ticket type you've probaly missed ðŸ˜²

When you a task on your hand you're almost ready to go. However, there may be few people involved even if a single technical unit like an endpoint or UI component. Some person can be responsible for the DevOps and deployment some for coding and some for testing. Here subtasks come in handy. If you feel like spliting a task is an overhead this is totally fine. Subtasks are completely optional. They are mostly needed if you need to assign parts of a task to different people.

This is also a team-level business. No one outside of a team have a say in this. Team lead or any other senior-level person can create a ticket of that type. A subtask describe a precise set of actions for a single person. So the assignee is the only one person who should review the ticket.

If a few people needed to complete a single task subtasks come into play. They come in handy sometimes but a scrum team should focus on writing a good user story and tasks first.
