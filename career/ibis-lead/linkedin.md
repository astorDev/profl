# Becoming Ibis Team Lead Announcement

At the end of last year, I was given a Team Lead role! ðŸŽ‰

I'm excited to see what my team and I will build this year! Our B2B product aims to simplify payments by connecting crypto and fiat economies. Can't wait to share our progress with you!

With the new role comes a new photo! ðŸ˜Š
