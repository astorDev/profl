## Career

I want to build a personal brand of a CTO.



By: consistently blogging, networking, seeking responsibilities at the job, and developing personal project.

### Blogging

To secure a CTO level job post topics should be diverse and include both technical and non-technical topics. And also include both high-level and deep-dive topics.
An example list may be:

- Coding tips and trends.
- High-level Architecture like cloud.
- Project Managements
- Leadership
- Self-improvement and productivity
- Coding challenges / experiments
- Coding tutorials 
- Impacted open-source projects (like Nist).

At 29 I want to have:
- A blog which doesn't have a week without a post.
- At least 3 green squares per week on GitHub.

### Networking

- Meetups
- Keep contact with other IT specialists. Try organizing a project team.

### Job

The golden questiong: what can I do to gain a promotion?

What I think I haven't done:
- Seeking constant feedback 
- Communicate with upper management. 

### Personal project. Finrir

One of the actual way to become a CTO is to develop a product that brings money. That's also helpful to build a team around the product to show leadership skills.

At 29 I want to have:
- An app deployed to the app store for which an update shipped at least once a month.
- A supportive landing and a web version.
