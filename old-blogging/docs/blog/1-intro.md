Landings with #flutter?

I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but here I go anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  
I have made my personal portfolio website with Flutter.  
Surprisingly, my name domain wasn't occupied, so you can check this [egortarasov.com](https://egortarasov.com).  
Check out the repository too: [https://github.com/astordev/profl/](https://github.com/astordev/profl/)

I'm going to drop some posts later about my journey, so that you can learn in a minutes, what take me hours to figure out. I hope that will help you go faster with your own flutter adventures. If you have something you would like to know, please, let me know in the comments. Keep coding!
