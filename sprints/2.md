# Scrum Tickets

As part of topics diversification, a management-related post is needed. The idea is to start by discussing different types of tickets in Scrum. So one LinkedIn post for one issue type with finalizing medium article:

- Epic
- User Story
- Backlog Item
- Task

For each of the ticket types, answer: 

- People in which roles interact with it?
- Why is it needed?

For the medium article, consider creating a joined roles picture. Possible structure

- Introduction, teasing having a whole picture in the end
- Epic section
- User story section
- Product Backlog Item
- Task
- The joined flow

## Epic

- Writes: CTO / CEO / Product Officer
- Reviews: Project Manager / Bussiness Analyst
- Why: Helps in organizing the backlog and delivery management. Provides a high-level context to all the team members. Guides user stories creation. Ideally, sets limits to narrow user stories scope
