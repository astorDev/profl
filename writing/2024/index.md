# My 2024 on Medium

With 2024 coming to an end it's time to reflect on the Medium articles I wrote this year: what went good, what went bad, what was surprising, and what I learned. I grouped my articles in X categories, so let me walk you through them one by one

## Category 1. C# and .NET

## Category 2. Flutter

## Category 3. DevOps and Infrastructure 

## Category 4. Others: General Computer Science, Scrum, Productivity

## To the Next Year!

So, what's next? Well, most of the time I write about a problem I am facing right now: be it in my job, with my personal project, or just something that occupies my head for other reasons. With that in mind, this is my forecast for each category:

- **`C#` and `.NET`** - Perhaps nothing would change globally (It's the most performant category, after all). But with the foundation I built, I'll be able to explain more holistic solutions I have, so long-form articles are coming!
- **Flutter**. Although the category also performs well the platform is not something I use commercially. So there's a chance I will not be able to find so much time for Flutter - there will likely be fewer articles on that.
- **DevOps**. We'll see how much I will be involved with such things in the next year. For now, it seems like nothing significant is going to change, so the article's pace will stay roughly the same. Perhaps, something should change about the way I present articles since some are getting less traction than I expected. But I don't have anything specific in mind.
- **Others**. Despite being the category being a loser of 2024 I will unlikely give up on it. Maybe I should tune the way I structure those articles. You will definitely see me experimenting with new approaches in the upcoming year, but again I have nothing specific to tell you yet.

Have something you want to read about from me or have some advice? I would be very happy to hear it and collaborate. And ... claps are appreciated, too! And see you in the next year!
