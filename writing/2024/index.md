# My 2024 on Medium

With 2024 coming to an end it's time to reflect on the Medium articles I wrote this year: what went good, what went bad, what was surprising, and what I learned. I grouped my articles into 4 categories, so let me walk you through them one by one.

## ü¶Ñ Category 1. C# and .NET

Well, I'm a professional C# developer, so it is not surprising that this category is the most popular. Surprises came from the performance of a few articles, with some having disappointedly low performance, while others exceeded expectations. Let's talk about each of them one by one. 

### [Exception Handling in ASP.NET Core](https://medium.com/p/9fded06f8ec1) 

~10 views. Well, I published the article not so far ago, so the numbers could be deceiving. The article looks very similar to the most performant articles as it covers the fundamental gaps in ASP .NET Core, suggesting a pretty universal solution.

### [Web3 With C#: A Practical Example](https://medium.com/p/a713cf3ddb63)

~50 views. A colleague of mine recently sent me this article, with a message "Look, what I've bumped into!". This was both pleasant and ironic since this is the least-read C# article I have. The modest amount of views is also surprising having that the hype around web3 didn't seem to disappear and the bitcoin was at the time of writing constantly testing the all-time high.

### [.NET Timers: All You Need to Know](https://medium.com/p/d020c73b63a4)

~200 views. The .NET ecosystem is pretty weird. ASP .NET Core is, in my opinion, the GOAT of Web Api frameworks. It's extremely well-documented and thought-through. But when it comes to background services Microsoft just leaves us with "You'll figure it out". Well, in this article, I've tried to do just that. I understand why it doesn't have many views, the whole domain of background jobs seems to be undiscovered so it's hard to find people there. But there is nothing else left other than keep walking the path.

### [Creating Strongly-Typed API Clients in .NET](https://medium.com/p/d87a3d7ef016) 

250+ views. As with exception handling, this article is pretty new, so the numbers may not properly reflect the interest. I personally think the topic is very important since the situation with http services clients is also very weird. We do have a pretty good and flexible `HttpClient` infrastructure. Still, there's no guide on how to use it to get a full client for a specific API. Well, the article is my attempt to make one.

### [.NET Configuration Architecture: AppSettings](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/net-configuration-architecture-appsettings-a0a718e8e8e1)

~400 views. This is the least viewed article from the configuration articles cycle. Unlike the other articles, this one focuses more on architecture. It tries to clarify how appsettings are frequently misused and proposes an alternative architectural approach. I would probably get more views if I've named it something like "You are using `appsettings.json` wrong .NET!", but I'm a little allergic to clickbait, so we'll have what we have.

### [How C# Dictionary Actually Works](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/how-c-dictionary-actually-works-47f3a156055b)

~500 views. The article idea was born when I couldn't answer an in-depth question about a dictionary in a job interview. Well, now I can and hopefully, this article could help you, too. Honestly, I expected a little bit more views on this article since it involves a fundamental topic, which is also relatively common for an interview. But again we have what we have

### [.env in .NET](https://medium.com/p/aa0a8dc4b68c)

600+ views. This is another article about configuration. Although I'm a little allergic to click-bait I do like fancy names - gladly, the short name didn't stop the articles from getting a solid number of views. In my view, .env files are the only missing part in a default .NET configuration, so this is fortunate that there's an interest in this topic.

### [Kafka with C# and .NET: Getting Started](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/kafka-with-c-and-net-getting-started-81c72fbba5bb)

750+ views. Well, the article kind of stands by itself. It gave me solid views, but I needed Kafka just once and there is probably not much left to say. I would say the article is the result of me writing a "Getting Started" doc instead of Kafka engineers. But hey, someone should've done that.

### [.NET Configuration Architecture: Getting Started](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/net-configuration-architecture-getting-started-87526b9fbc68)

~800 views

### [Making Your OpenAPI (Swagger) Docs UI Awesome in .NET 9](https://medium.com/p/67fbde6b71b5)

1300+ views. That's kind of funny that this article is in the top 4. Of course, I do recommend having Swagger for basically everyone, still writing the articles was a little bit boring. Also, for this article, the credits are due to Nick Chapsas, as the fundamentals of the articles are from his video. In the article, I just filled the gaps I found both in the Scalar docs and in the video.

### [JSON Logs in C# and .NET](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/json-logs-in-c-and-net-335009e3a984)

1600+ views. There is not much to say about this article. It took Microsoft a few releases to give us a JSON logger, yet it was not very well done. So in this article, I've presented the problems I have and gave an alternative and I think the views are pretty proportional to the impact.

### [Request-Response Logging in ASP .NET Core](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/request-response-logging-in-asp-net-core-edbb09075149)

4600+ views. Here comes the titan. Here the story is very similar to the JSON logs article. Just filling the gaps in ASP .NET Core and getting solid views for that. 

### [Environment Variables in ASP .NET Core](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/environment-variables-in-asp-net-core-d6b4ea6cff9f)

5200+ views. And here comes the GOAT. The story is about the same for the last 3 articles. But the thing is that this is highly scalable as there are not many things Microsoft does poorly with ASP .NET Core. Ironically, as a .NET developer, I hope that the articles will become obsolete in the future. That is a little terrifying, but I believe I will find something even more complex and vital to fix.

### Summary

Those 13 articles in total brought 16'000+ views, exceeding the total number of views in all other categories. Of course, in the next year, I will continue this category - it is my craft after all. You can probably expect longer and more holistic articles in the upcoming year. 

## üê¶ Category 2. Flutter

I use a pretty uncommon tech stack. Unfortunately, there are not many jobs that expect such a combination of backend and frontend technology. However, since I'm also developing my personal projects I need a technology that will allow me to create mobile apps. I spent a lot of time experimenting with various mobile development platforms, including native. But nothing gave me even close satisfaction in terms of development experience. 

In this category, article views are even more volatile and unpredictable than with C#. So, let me walk you through the situation here.

### [Flutter Animations: Getting Started](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/flutter-animations-getting-started-300a1ed679cc)

### [Customizing CupertinoDatePicker in Flutter](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/customizing-cupertinodatepicker-in-flutter-e032aeccbe50)

1800+ views

### Total

With 8 articles I get a total of 2'800+ views here. Notably, the most performant article here gave almost twice as all the other articles in the category. 

Although, I'm a fan of Flutter the number of articles is likely to shrink in the next year. It's just the case that I have a lot going on right now and may not have time for my personal project and this is the only place where I use Flutter

## üê≥ Category 3. DevOps and Infrastructure

Besides coding, both my job and my personal project require some DevOps efforts. I'm often surprised by the quality of tutorials and guides in this category. So, from time to time, I write my own. Here the number of views is almost always the opposite of my perception of article values. Let me demonstrate it:

### [Talking Shell Scripts: An Architectural Journey](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/talking-shell-scripts-an-architectural-journey-6d0c642b0613)

~15 views

### [Marketplacing a Shell GitHub Action](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/marketplacing-a-shell-github-action-c021eb74e951)

~1000 views

### [Postgres VS Mongo: Performance Comparison for semi-structured data](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/postgres-vs-mongo-performance-comparison-for-semi-structured-data-9a5ec6486cf6)

1600+ views

### Total

The 7 articles in the category brought me **3'300+** views in total. As I described the distribution is very odd for me. I think in the upcoming year the pace will be about the same. I'm also not stopping with the unpopular articles, since they at least let me put my thoughts and knowledge on the topic together. And with this category, it's really hard to figure out what will take off.

## Category 4. Others: General Computer Science, Scrum, Productivity

It's hard to describe the last category. I write about anything that occupies my head. Although the views are very moderate, only articles in this section I feel could be long-lasting. By long-lasting I mean that even my grandchildren could find something interesting.

Perhaps, I'm doing something wrong with the titles, though. Or it's just much harder to grab attention on such broad topics as it's way more competitive. Anyway, here are my thoughts about the articles in this section:

### [I Got Kicked Out Of the AppStore. Now What?](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/i-got-kicked-out-of-the-appstore-now-what-0208e7b945e7)

### [Material 3 (You) Typography Cheatsheet](https://medium.com/@vosarat1995/material-3-you-typography-cheatsheet-ffc58c540181)

~840 views

### Total

Here with 11 articles I only got 1'400+ views. As in the previous section, the actual views are almost reversed from what I expected. 

Here the next year's challenge is probably to continue writing about the thing that bothers me, yet finding a way to make it sound more interesting for other people. This section wraps up the main part of the article, but let me say just a few final words!

## To the Next Year!

So, what's next? Well, most of the time I write about a problem I am facing right now: be it in my job, with my personal project, or just something that occupies my head for other reasons. With that in mind, this is my forecast for each category:

- **`C#` and `.NET`** - Perhaps nothing would change globally (It's the most performant category, after all). But with the foundation I built, I'll be able to explain more holistic solutions I have, so long-form articles are coming!
- **Flutter**. Although the category also performs well the platform is not something I use commercially. So there's a chance I will not be able to find so much time for Flutter - there will likely be fewer articles on that.
- **DevOps**. We'll see how much I will be involved with such things in the next year. For now, it seems like nothing significant is going to change, so the article's pace will stay roughly the same. Perhaps, something should change about the way I present articles since some are getting less traction than I expected. But I don't have anything specific in mind.
- **Others**. Despite being the category being a loser of 2024 I will unlikely give up on it. Maybe I should tune the way I structure those articles. You will definitely see me experimenting with new approaches in the upcoming year, but again I have nothing specific to tell you yet.

Have something you want to read about from me or have some advice? I would be very happy to hear it and collaborate. And ... claps are appreciated, too! üëâüëà

See you in the next year! üéÑ
